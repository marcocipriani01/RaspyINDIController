# Raspberry INDI Controller
indiserver starter/stopper, network manager and system shutdown/reboot via Bluetooth for Raspberry Pi (Raspbian only, tested on 3 B+). Installers in the `install-kit` folder will guide you through updating the system, installing, configuring and starting the server and its dependencies, just run them in the correct order. If you don't need OpenFocuser, script 4 can be skipped without problems. You'll be asked for an hostname for the server, a password for the hotspot mode and the network interface to control via Bluetooth. INDI and bluez will be downloaded/updated automatically and common troubles about Bluetooth in Raspbian will be fixed. Then some systemd services will be setted up to correctly start the Bluetooth controller and indiserver.
